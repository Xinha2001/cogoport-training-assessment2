The project is submitted by Saurabh Sinha (NIT Silchar) and was made using React JS primarily. In order to run the project correctly, please follow the steps below:

1. Download the ZIP code from Github

2. Extract the code to a new folder

3. Make sure all of the files are extracted correctly to the new folder, now open the folder in the VS Code editor.

4. Now, open terminal and make sure the terminal has the path of the folder.

5. Hit npm install, and if npm install is showing any dependency errors, kindly install the files required, if already not existing in pc.

6. Run the command: npm config set legacy-peer-deps true  (****Only run this command in terminal if file not existing in the client side pc****).

7. Hit npm install, then npm start to run the project in the default web browser.

Just as a footer note, if you want to set the --legacy-peer-deps flag by default for all of your NPM installs, then you can consider updating the . npmrc file. The . npmrc file is a configuration file used by the Node Package Manager (npm) to manage settings and options for the npm client. Also make sure the local host mention is correct in the URL section, for example it should be named as "localhost:3000" or "http://localhost:3000/" in the URL section to run it successfully.
